# Ãœbung 5 
## Game
This project is a simple console program that prompts the user to solve seven random mathematical calculations and measures their response time and accuracy. The results of the user are stored in an ArrayList and printed at the end of the program, along with the average time to solve each calculation. If the user inputs all seven calculation correctly, the program prompts a message, that all calculations are answered correctly.
## Installation
Before you install *uebung5_game*, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. IF you don't have JDK installed, please follow the [JDK Installation Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) to download and install the appropriate version for your operating system.

To install *uebung5_game* download *uebung5_game.zip* folder and unpack it. After following these steps, you will have the necessary files to compile and run the program as described in the "How to Run" section.
## How to Run
To run *uebung5_game* you can compile the program by navigating to the directory where you extracted the files and running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
javac Application.java Calculation.java Participation.java
```
Run the program by running the command:
```bash
java Application
```
The program will prompt you to solve seven random mathematical calculations. For each calculation, enter your answer and press *Enter*. The program will measure your response time and accuracy and store the results in an ArrayList. At the end of the Program, the details of each participation and the average time needed to solve each calculation are printed. If you answer all questions correctly, the program will print:
```bash
Congratulations - you answered all questions correctly!
```
