# Good Coding and Version Control Practices

## Writing Good Source Code Comments

Good source code comments are essential for maintainable code. They help other developers and your future self, understand why certain decisions were made. Here are some best practices:

1. **Clarity**: Make sure your comments are clear and easy to understand.
2. **Conciseness**: While your comments should be descriptive, they should also be as brief as possible.
3. **Relevance**: Comment why the code does something, not what it does. The latter should be clear from the code itself.
4. **Up-to-date**: Make sure to update your comments as you update your code. 

## Writing Good Git Commit Messages

Good commit messages communicate what has changed and why. Here are some best practices:

1. **Imperative Mood**: Start your commit message in the imperative mood. e.g., "Add", "Fix", etc.
2. **Line between Summary/Heading and Main Text**: Separate the summary from the body with a blank line. Short messages may only have a heading line.
3. **Short Summary/Heading Start with Capital Letter**: The first letter of the summary should be a capital letter.
4. **Describe What and Why in Main Text**: The commit message body should explain what changed and why. Avoid discussing how the changes are implemented, as this should be clear from the code itself.
