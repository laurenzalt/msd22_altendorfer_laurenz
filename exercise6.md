# Maven Site Documentation Configuration

## Necessary Steps to Generate Maven Site Documentation

1. Ensure Maven is installed and the project's `pom.xml` file is properly configured.
2. Include necessary plugins like `maven-site-plugin` and other necessary for your project.
3. Run `mvn site` command to generate the site.

## Configurations in site.xml and pom.xml

### pom.xml

The POM file includes configurations for plugins used in the generation of the Maven site:

- `maven-site-plugin`: Basic plugin to generate a site for the project.
- `maven-javadoc-plugin`: Generates Javadoc for the project.
- `maven-project-info-reports-plugin`: Generates project information reports.

### site.xml

`site.xml` is the configuration file for the Maven Site Plugin. It defines the structure of the documentation site:

- Menu entries, their order and nesting.
- Reference to the project's `pom.xml` file.
- Any additional pages or documents to be included in the site.

Remember to link and refer to documents correctly in `site.xml`, so they are correctly built into the final site.
